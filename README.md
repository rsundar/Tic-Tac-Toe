# Technologies Used

# Game Instructions
- The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
- Player 1 is X and Player 2 is O.
- Players take turns putting their marks in the numbered squares.
- The first player to get 3 in a row wins.
- 3 in a row implies the presence of 3 of the same marker ('X' or 'O') in consecutive positions.
- That is horizontally consecutive, vertically consecutive, or diagonally consecutive.
- When all 9 squares are full, the game is a draw, if no player has won.
